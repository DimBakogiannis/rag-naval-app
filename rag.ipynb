I've been absorbing your information and listening to you talk for quite a while now, so it's great to actually meet you. Thanks for having me. My pleasure, my pleasure. You are one of the rare guys that is, you're a big investor, you're deep in the tech world, but yet you seem to have a very balanced perspective in terms of how to live life, as opposed to not just be entirely focused on success and financial success and tech investing, but rather how to live your life in a happy way. That's a, it's a, it's not balance. Yeah, you know, I think the reason why people like hearing me is because like if it's like, if you go to a circus and you see a bear, right, that's kind of interesting, but not that much. If you see a unicycle, that's interesting, but you see a bear on a unicycle, that's really interesting, right? So when you combine things, you're not supposed to combine. Right. People get interested. It's a Bruce Lee, right, striking thoughts, philosophy, plus martial arts. And I think it's because of some level, all humans are broad. We're all multivariate, but we get summarized in pithy ways in our lives, and at some deep level, we know that's not true, right? Every human basically is capable of every experience and every thought. Your UFC comedian, commentator, podcaster, but you're also more than that. You're also father, lover, thinker, et cetera. So I like the model of life that the ancients had, the Greeks, the Romans, right, where you would start out, and when you're young, you're just like going to school, then you're going to war, then you're running a business, then you're supposed to serve in the Senate or the government, then you become a philosopher, this sort of this arc to life, where you try your hand at everything.
